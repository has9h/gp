# Gaussian Processes

GP scripts for the [Baryons from Mesons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10445) paper.

`keeganhines` and `freitas-krasserm-turner` have scripts for implementing GPs from scratch, and using `scikit-learn`.

`baryons-from-mesons` have the original codes for the paper. Implemented with `MATLAB` and `Mathematica`. Neural Network scripts also present.
